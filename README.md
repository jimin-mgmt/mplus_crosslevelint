# mplus_crosslevelint
This is a Mplus syntax for cross-level interaction between a L1 independent variable and L2 moderator, computed by creating random slopes in which each slope includes effects of an IV and L1 control variables on DV. These simple slopes are regressed onto a level 2 moderator for cross-level interaction analyses.
